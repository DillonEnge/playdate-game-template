# playdate-game-template

This is a simple barebones game template to use as a boiler-plate for new playdate projects written in Lua

# usage

Running `make compile` in the root directory  will result in a .pdx file being created with the name of the directory prefixed (ie. playdate-game-template.pdx)
You can then load into your simulater via `make open` if you are on Mac otherwise you will need to manually load the .pdx package into the simulator.

Enjoy!
